									<h1>About me</h1>
									<p>Hello, My name is Zack. I graduated in 2020 in the University of Hong Kong majoring
										in Accounting and Finance.<br />
									Currently, I am studying in the University of Birmingham pursuing a Master in computer science.<br />
									</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/aboutme.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p> From a young age, I have always been interested in how computers operate. With merely “0” and “1”, computers are able to store image and data. By utilizing various algorithms, computers can even perform various tasks. Computer games are always attractive to me and I am always amazed by the graphic.
									<br/>
									<br/>
									It was not until I took a programming class related to Java during my junior year (2019) did I realize that I wanted to learn more about programming. I never gained extremely useful insights from my business classes, and I believe that Java is the most useful tool I learned during my undergraduate degree. The class also incentivized me to explore more about programming. After completing the class, I started learning Python through YouTube and other sources on the internet.
									After graduated from the University of Hong Kong, I have decided to study a computer science conversion course as I really want to learn more about computer science and become better in programming.
									Upon graduating from the programme, I wish to be a software engineer or an IT consultant. I made this website so that I can share my projects I did during the process of me learning python and maybe other programming language.
									<br/>
